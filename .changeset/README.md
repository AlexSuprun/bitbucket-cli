# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
bun changeset
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
2. Write a summary of your changes

The changeset file will be committed with your PR.

## Releasing

When changesets are merged to main, a "Version Packages" PR is automatically created.
Merging that PR will:

- Update the version in package.json
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Publish to GitHub Packages
- Create a GitHub release with the changelog
