## General

### Is this an official Atlassian/Bitbucket tool?

No. This is an **unofficial**, community-maintained CLI tool. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Atlassian or Bitbucket. The project is open source and maintained by volunteers.

---

### How does this compare to GitHub CLI (gh)?

The Bitbucket CLI is inspired by GitHub's excellent `gh` CLI and aims to provide a similar experience for Bitbucket users:

| Feature | GitHub CLI | Bitbucket CLI |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Authentication | OAuth/token | API token |
| Repository management | Yes | Yes |
| Pull requests | Yes | Yes |
| Issues | Yes | Not yet |
| Actions/Pipelines | Yes | Not yet |
| Gists/Snippets | Yes | Not yet |
| JSON output | Yes | Yes |
| Shell completion | Yes | Yes |

---

### What Bitbucket features are supported?

Currently supported:

- **Authentication** - Login, logout, status, token display
- **Repositories** - Clone, create, list, view, delete
- **Pull Requests** - Create, list, view, merge, approve, decline, checkout, diff
- **Configuration** - Get, set, list settings
- **Shell Completion** - Bash, Zsh, Fish

Not yet supported:
- Issues
- Pipelines
- Snippets
- Branch permissions
- Webhooks

---

### Does this work with Bitbucket Server/Data Center?

No. Currently, the CLI only supports **Bitbucket Cloud**. Bitbucket Server (self-hosted) uses a different API and is not supported.

If you need Bitbucket Server support, please [open an issue](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues) to let us know.

---

## Authentication

### Where are my credentials stored?

Credentials are stored in a local configuration file:

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| macOS/Linux | `~/.config/bb/config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\bb\config.json` |

The file is created with restricted permissions (owner read/write only on Unix systems).

<Aside type="caution">
Never share this file or commit it to version control.
</Aside>

---

### Can I use app passwords?

**No, app passwords are deprecated.**

As of September 9, 2025, Bitbucket app passwords can no longer be created. Existing app passwords will be disabled on June 9, 2026.

Use **API tokens** instead:
1. Go to [Bitbucket API Tokens](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/api-tokens/)
2. Create a new token with required scopes

---

### How do I use multiple Bitbucket accounts?

The CLI doesn't have built-in multi-account support, but you can work around this:

**Option 1: Environment variables per session**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Account A
export BB_USERNAME=account-a
export BB_API_TOKEN=token-a

# Terminal 2 - Account B
export BB_USERNAME=account-b
export BB_API_TOKEN=token-b
```

**Option 2: Alias with different configs**
```bash
# In your .bashrc/.zshrc
alias bb-work='BB_USERNAME=work BB_API_TOKEN=work-token bb'
alias bb-personal='BB_USERNAME=personal BB_API_TOKEN=personal-token bb'
```

---

### What scopes does my token need?

Minimum required scopes:

| Scope | Required For |
|-------|-------------|
| `account:read` | `bb auth status` |
| `repository:read` | `bb repo list`, `bb repo view` |
| `repository:write` | `bb repo create` |
| `repository:admin` | `bb repo delete` |
| `pullrequest:read` | `bb pr list`, `bb pr view` |
| `pullrequest:write` | `bb pr create`, `bb pr merge` |

<Aside type="tip">
For full functionality, grant all repository and pull request scopes.
</Aside>

---

## Commands

### How do I avoid typing workspace/repo every time?

**Option 1:** Set defaults
```bash
bb config set workspace myworkspace
bb config set repo myrepo
```

**Option 2:** Work from cloned repositories
```bash
cd /path/to/myrepo
bb pr list  # Auto-detects from git remote
```

See [Repository Context](/guides/repository-context/) for details.

---

### Does bb support interactive mode?

Not currently. All commands require flags or arguments. There's no interactive prompt mode like some other CLIs offer.

If you'd like this feature, please [open an issue](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues).

---

### Can I create a PR from uncommitted changes?

No. You must:
1. Commit your changes
2. Push to a remote branch
3. Then create the PR

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "My changes"
git push -u origin my-branch
bb pr create -t "My PR"
```

---

### How do I see what's in a PR before checking it out?

Use `bb pr diff`:
```bash
# View changes
bb pr diff 42

# Just see changed files
bb pr diff 42 --name-only

# See statistics
bb pr diff 42 --stat
```

---

## Integration

### Can I use bb in CI/CD pipelines?

Yes! See the [CI/CD Integration Guide](/guides/cicd/) for complete examples.

Quick setup:
1. Store credentials as CI/CD secrets
2. Set environment variables: `BB_USERNAME`, `BB_API_TOKEN`
3. Install the CLI and run commands

---

### How do I pipe output to other commands?

Use the `--json` flag for machine-readable output:

```bash
# List PR titles
bb pr list --json | jq '.[].title'

# Get PR count
bb pr list --json | jq 'length'

# Filter by author
bb pr list --json | jq '.[] | select(.author.username == "alice")'
```

---

### Can I use bb with git hooks?

Yes! Example pre-push hook to check for open PRs:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push

branch=$(git branch --show-current)
prs=$(bb pr list --json 2>/dev/null | jq --arg b "$branch" '[.[] | select(.source.branch.name == $b)] | length')

if [ "$prs" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "Note: PR already exists for branch $branch"
fi
```

---

## Update Notifications

### How do I disable update notifications?

The CLI automatically checks for updates when you run `bb` without any subcommands. To disable this:

```bash
bb config set skipVersionCheck true
```

### How often does the CLI check for updates?

By default, the CLI checks once per day (24 hours). You can change this interval:

```bash
# Check weekly
bb config set versionCheckInterval 7

# Check every 3 days
bb config set versionCheckInterval 3
```

The value is in days.

### Will update checks slow down the CLI?

No. The check is:
- Performed asynchronously after displaying help
- Cached for 24 hours (or your configured interval)
- Skipped entirely in CI environments
- Silently fails if npm registry is unreachable

### Does the CLI auto-update?

No. The CLI only notifies you that an update is available. You must manually update:

```bash
bun install -g @pilatos/bitbucket-cli
```
