## Why Bitbucket CLI?

If you've used GitHub's `gh` CLI and loved it, you've probably wished for something similar for Bitbucket. **Now you have it.**

  <Card title="Automate Everything" icon="rocket">
    JSON output, scriptable commands, and CI/CD integration. Build automated workflows with ease.
  </Card>

    Inspired by GitHub CLI, so if you know `gh`, you'll feel right at home with `bb`.
