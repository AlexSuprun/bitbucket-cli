import { Steps, Aside, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Get productive with the Bitbucket CLI in under a minute.

## TL;DR

```bash
npm install -g @pilatos/bitbucket-cli
bb auth login -u your-username -p your-api-token
bb repo clone myworkspace/myrepo
bb pr create -t "My feature"
```

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime 1.0+** installed (required to run the CLI)
- A **Bitbucket Cloud** account
- An **API token** (we'll create one below)

<Aside type="caution">
The CLI requires Bun runtime to execute. You can install the package via npm/pnpm/bun, but Bun must be available on your system to run `bb` commands.
</Aside>

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>

1. **Install the CLI**

   ```bash
   npm install -g @pilatos/bitbucket-cli
   ```

   Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   bb --version
   ```

2. **Create an API Token**

   1. Go to [Bitbucket API Tokens](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/api-tokens/)
   2. Click **Create API token**
   3. Name it (e.g., "bb CLI")
   4. Select scopes:
      - Account: Read
      - Repositories: Read, Write
      - Pull requests: Read, Write
   5. Click **Create** and copy the token

   <Aside type="caution">
   Save your token now! You won't be able to see it again.
   </Aside>

3. **Authenticate**

   ```bash
   bb auth login
   ```

   Enter your Bitbucket username and the API token when prompted.

   Verify it worked:
   ```bash
   bb auth status
   ```

4. **Clone a Repository**

   ```bash
   bb repo clone myworkspace/myrepo
   cd myrepo
   ```

5. **Create Your First PR**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   # Make some changes...
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add my feature"
   git push -u origin feature/my-feature

   bb pr create -t "Add my feature"
   ```

</Steps>

## Common Commands

Here are the commands you'll use most often:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bb pr list` | List open pull requests |
| `bb pr view 42` | View PR #42 details |
| `bb pr activity 42` | View PR #42 activity log |
| `bb pr create -t "Title"` | Create a new PR |
| `bb pr merge 42` | Merge PR #42 |
| `bb pr checkout 42` | Checkout PR #42 locally |
| `bb pr diff 42` | View PR #42 diff |
| `bb repo list` | List repositories |

---

## Set a Default Workspace

If you work primarily in one workspace, set it as default:

```bash
bb config set defaultWorkspace myworkspace
```

Now commands will use this workspace automatically:

```bash
bb repo list          # Lists repos in "myworkspace"
bb pr list -r myrepo  # Lists PRs in "myworkspace/myrepo"
```

---

## Enable Tab Completion

Get intelligent tab completion for commands and options:

```bash
bb completion install
```

Restart your shell, then try:

```bash
bb pr <Tab>      # Shows: activity, approve, checkout, create, decline, diff, list, merge, ready, view
bb pr create -<Tab>  # Shows available flags
```
