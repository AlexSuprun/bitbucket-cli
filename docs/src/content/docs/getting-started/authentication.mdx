The Bitbucket CLI uses **API Tokens** for authentication. This is a secure way to grant CLI access without exposing your main account password.

<Aside type="caution" title="App Passwords Deprecated">
As of September 9, 2025, Bitbucket app passwords are deprecated and can no longer be created. All existing app passwords will be disabled on June 9, 2026. Use API tokens instead.
</Aside>

## Create an API Token

1. Log in to [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
2. Go to **Personal settings** (click your avatar in the bottom left)
3. Navigate to **API tokens** under "Access management"
4. Click **Create API token**
5. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Bitbucket CLI")
6. Select the required scopes:
   - **Account**: Read
   - **Repositories**: Read, Write, Admin (depending on your needs)
   - **Pull requests**: Read, Write
7. Click **Create**
8. **Copy the generated token** - you won't be able to see it again!

## Login

```bash
bb auth login -u your-username -p your-api-token
```

### Using Environment Variables

You can also set credentials via environment variables, which is especially useful for CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
export BB_USERNAME=your-username
export BB_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
bb auth login
```

See [Environment Variables Reference](/reference/environment-variables/) for more details on using environment variables in scripts and CI/CD.

## Check Auth Status

```bash
bb auth status
```

This shows your current authentication status and account information.

## Logout

```bash
bb auth logout
```

This removes stored credentials from your system.

## Configuration Storage

Credentials are stored in:

- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/bb/config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\bb\config.json`

See [Configuration File Reference](/reference/configuration/) for details on the config file format.

<Aside type="caution">
Never share your API token or config file. Keep them secure!
