Manage authentication with Bitbucket.

## `bb auth login`

Authenticate with Bitbucket using an app password.

```bash
bb auth login [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-u, --username <username>` | Bitbucket username |
| `-p, --password <password>` | Bitbucket app password |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

### Examples

```bash
# Login with credentials via command line
bb auth login -u myuser -p myapppassword

# Login using environment variables
export BB_USERNAME=myuser
export BB_APP_PASSWORD=myapppassword
bb auth login
```

### How It Works

1. You provide your Bitbucket username and app password
2. The CLI stores the credentials securely in your config file
3. The CLI verifies the credentials by fetching your user information
4. If verification fails, credentials are not saved

### Required Permissions

Your app password needs these permissions:
- **Account**: Read (to verify your identity)
- **Repositories**: Read, Write (depending on operations you'll perform)
- **Pull requests**: Read, Write (for PR operations)

See the [Authentication guide](/getting-started/authentication/) for detailed setup instructions.

## `bb auth logout`

Log out of Bitbucket and remove stored credentials.

```bash
bb auth logout [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

### Examples

```bash
bb auth logout
```

### What Gets Removed

This command removes your stored credentials (`username` and `appPassword`) from the config file. Other settings like `workspace` and `repo` are preserved.

## `bb auth status`

Show current authentication status and account information.

```bash
bb auth status [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

### Examples

```bash
# Check authentication status
bb auth status

# Get status as JSON
bb auth status --json
```

### Output

When authenticated:
```
✓ Logged in to Bitbucket
  Username: myuser
  Display name: My Name
  Account ID: 123456789
```

When not authenticated:
```
ℹ Not logged in
Run bb auth login to authenticate.
```

## `bb auth token`

Print the current access token (base64 encoded credentials).

```bash
bb auth token [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

### Examples

```bash
# Print the token
bb auth token

# Get token as JSON
bb auth token --json
```

### Use Cases

This is useful for:
- Debugging authentication issues
- Using the token with other tools or scripts
- Verifying token format

:::caution
Keep your token secure! Anyone with this token can access your Bitbucket account with the permissions you've granted to the app password.
