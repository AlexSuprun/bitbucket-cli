# Changelog

## 1.22.0

### Minor Changes

- [#293](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/293) [`2b77891`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/2b77891d691d7dd471241915e74fb6288e3831a3) Thanks [@AlexSuprun](https://github.com/AlexSuprun)! - Complete the `bb pr comments` surface with four new subcommands (issue [#292](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/292)): `bb pr comments view <pr-id> <comment-id>` shows one comment with its author, date, state (`[resolved]`/`[unresolved]`/`[pending]`) and raw content; `bb pr comments reply <pr-id> <comment-id> <message>` posts a threaded reply attached to the parent comment; `bb pr comments resolve <pr-id> <comment-id>` and `bb pr comments unresolve <pr-id> <comment-id>` close and reopen a comment thread. All four support `--json`. Note that the Bitbucket API returns only a resolution record for `resolve` and no body for `unresolve`, so their JSON payloads carry the identifiers (plus the resolution for `resolve`) rather than the full comment — use `bb pr comments view` to read the comment back.

### Patch Changes

- [#293](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/293) [`2b77891`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/2b77891d691d7dd471241915e74fb6288e3831a3) Thanks [@AlexSuprun](https://github.com/AlexSuprun)! - Fix `bb pr comments edit` failing with `Bad request`. The update payload sent a `type` key, which the Bitbucket comment endpoint rejects with `extra keys not allowed`; the body now carries content only. `bb pr comments reply` had the same problem on both `type` and `parent.type` and is fixed too.

  API errors now include Bitbucket's `error.fields` detail, so a rejected payload reports `Bad request (type: extra keys not allowed)` instead of a bare `Bad request`.

- [#293](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/293) [`2b77891`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/2b77891d691d7dd471241915e74fb6288e3831a3) Thanks [@AlexSuprun](https://github.com/AlexSuprun)! - Fix `bb pr comments resolve` failing with `Bad request` on every comment. The resolve endpoint declares no request payload, so the generated client sent no body at all, and Bitbucket rejects the POST without one. The command now sends an empty JSON body. `bb pr comments unresolve` was never affected — Bitbucket accepts that DELETE with no body.

## 1.21.1

### Patch Changes

- [`8dcf9f0`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/8dcf9f0f006718163c33ffbd1d666959eb64bf54) - Test runs are now isolated from real `BB_*` environment variables via a bun test preload, so a developer's working `bb` setup no longer breaks the test suite ([#294](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/294)). No functional changes to the CLI itself.

## 1.21.0

### Minor Changes

- [#290](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/290) [`941e1bd`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/941e1bd2a55b26a091949133aa7f633abe85a221) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add `bb commit` and `bb status` command groups. `bb commit list` lists commit history (defaulting to the current git branch, with `--ref <branch|tag|sha>` to pick any revision) and `bb commit view <sha>` shows full commit details including author, date, parents, and message. `bb status list <sha>` lists the build statuses reported on a commit, and `bb status set <sha> --key <key> --state <state>` creates or updates a build status — idempotently per key, so CI re-runs can safely re-report INPROGRESS/SUCCESSFUL/FAILED states. All commands support the standard repo-scoped context resolution, `--json`/`--jq` envelopes, and shell completion for `--state` values.

- [#290](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/290) [`941e1bd`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/941e1bd2a55b26a091949133aa7f633abe85a221) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add the `bb issue` command group for Bitbucket's built-in issue tracker, mirroring `gh issue` ergonomics: `bb issue list` (with `--state`/`--kind`/`--assignee`/`--reporter` filters and a raw `--query` escape hatch), `bb issue view <id>`, `bb issue create` (`--title`, `--body`/`--body-file`, `--kind`, `--priority`, `--assignee`), `bb issue edit <id>`, `bb issue close <id>` (optionally posting a `--comment` first), and `bb issue comment <id>`. All commands emit stable `--json` envelopes, and 404s from a disabled issue tracker are reported with an actionable message pointing at Repository settings → Issue tracker (many teams use Jira instead).

- [#290](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/290) [`941e1bd`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/941e1bd2a55b26a091949133aa7f633abe85a221) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add the `bb pipeline` command group for Bitbucket Pipelines (CI/CD): `bb pipeline list` (filter by `--status`/`--branch`, sortable, paginated), `bb pipeline view <id>` (details plus per-step summary), `bb pipeline run` (trigger on the current or a given branch, with `--commit`, custom `--pipeline` definitions, and repeatable `--var key=value` variables), `bb pipeline stop <id>`, and `bb pipeline logs <id>` (raw step logs with `--step` selection by UUID or index). Pipeline IDs are accepted as build numbers or UUIDs everywhere, and every command emits a stable, documented `--json` envelope.

- [#290](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/290) [`941e1bd`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/941e1bd2a55b26a091949133aa7f633abe85a221) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add the `bb workspace` and `bb project` command groups for discovery — no more guessing slugs and keys. `bb workspace list` shows every workspace you have access to (filterable with `--role owner|collaborator|member`) so you can pick a slug for `-w/--workspace` or `bb config set defaultWorkspace`, and `bb workspace view [slug]` shows workspace details (defaulting to the current workspace context). `bb project list` lists the projects in a workspace, `bb project view <key>` shows project details, and `bb project create --key <KEY> --name <name>` creates a project (private by default, `--public` to flip; keys are validated and uppercased automatically) ready for `bb repo create -p <KEY>`. All commands work non-interactively and emit stable, documented `--json` envelopes.

### Patch Changes

- [#290](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/290) [`941e1bd`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/941e1bd2a55b26a091949133aa7f633abe85a221) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Transient network failures (dropped sockets, temporary DNS hiccups, request timeouts) on read requests now retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff instead of failing immediately. Only idempotent methods (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS) are retried; write requests still fail fast since the CLI cannot know whether the server already processed them. Permanent-looking failures such as unknown host or connection refused are not retried.

- [#290](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/290) [`941e1bd`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/941e1bd2a55b26a091949133aa7f633abe85a221) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Concurrent API calls no longer race the OAuth token refresh. Refreshes are now serialized behind an in-flight lock, so parallel requests that see an expired token (or all hit 401) share a single POST to the token endpoint instead of each sending the rotated refresh token and silently logging you out.

- [#290](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/290) [`941e1bd`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/941e1bd2a55b26a091949133aa7f633abe85a221) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - All API surfaces (generated Bitbucket clients, snippet file transfers, and the `bb api` passthrough) now share a single configured HTTP client, so retry/backoff, OAuth token refresh, and timeout behavior are uniform across every command.

- [#288](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/288) [`2acd2e1`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/2acd2e10e5b808c5d3c35025e6ef36bf6bb9d3a0) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Derive shell completion from the live command tree instead of hand-maintained tables, so completion stays correct automatically as commands and flags change. This also adds flag-value completion for enum options: `bb pr merge --strategy <Tab>` suggests the valid merge strategies, `bb pr list --state <Tab>` the PR states, `bb snippet list --role <Tab>` the roles, `bb pr diff --color <Tab>` the color modes, and `bb api -X <Tab>` the HTTP methods. In zsh and fish each suggestion now carries its description.

  The change is purely additive: option validation and error output are unchanged — invalid values still raise the usual error (and honor `--json`), and `bb api -X get` stays case-insensitive.

## 1.20.1

### Patch Changes

- [#286](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/286) [`c95c4f0`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/c95c4f062d04ba0edcc25fbb11f3113dddb4a74c) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Advertise the global `--jq` flag in shell completion. It was a documented root option but was missing from the completion table, so `bb <tab>` never suggested it.

  Internally, a new drift-guard test now walks the live Commander command tree and fails CI if the hand-maintained shell-completion tables (`ROOT_COMPLETIONS`, `SUBCOMMAND_COMPLETIONS`, `COMMENTS_SUBCOMMANDS`) or the JSON `WRAPPER_ARRAY_KEYS` registry fall out of sync with the commands — turning a silent maintenance hazard into a build failure.

## 1.20.0

### Minor Changes

- [#283](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/283) [`848d30a`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/848d30ac5051f43d13e626e556936b787e79c596) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add a configurable request timeout to the Bitbucket API client. Requests now time out after 30s by default so the CLI no longer hangs forever when a server accepts a connection but never responds — important for CI and scripts. Configure it via the `BB_HTTP_TIMEOUT` environment variable (milliseconds; set `BB_HTTP_TIMEOUT=0` to disable). Timed-out requests now surface a clear network error that points to `BB_HTTP_TIMEOUT`.

- [#281](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/281) [`d11d40c`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/d11d40cec3de298821f1df2664abdfee965cbee6) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add `bb api`, a raw authenticated passthrough to the Bitbucket Cloud 2.0 API
  (mirrors `gh api`). It is the escape hatch for endpoints not yet wrapped by a
  typed command, reusing the shared authenticated stack (Basic/Bearer auth,
  OAuth refresh, retry, redaction).
  - `bb api [method] <endpoint>` — method may be a leading positional verb
    (`bb api GET /user`) or a path only (`bb api /user`); `-X/--method`
    overrides. Defaults to `GET`, or `POST` when fields/body are present.
  - `-f/--raw-field` (string) and `-F/--field` (typed: `true`/`false`/`null`,
    numbers, `@file`, `@-` for stdin). On `GET`/`HEAD` fields become query
    params; otherwise a JSON body.
  - `--input <file>` reads a raw request body (`-` for stdin); mutually
    exclusive with `-f`/`-F`.
  - `-H/--header` adds request headers; a user-supplied `Authorization` is
    rejected since auth is managed automatically.
  - `-i/--include` prints the HTTP status line and response headers before the
    body (text mode only).
  - `--paginate` follows the cursor (`next`) and merges every page's `values`.
  - `{workspace}` and `{repo}` placeholders are filled from `--workspace`/
    `--repo` or the current repository.
  - `--json [fields]` and `--jq` apply to the response; because `bb api` output
    is already JSON, `--jq` works without `--json`. Non-JSON bodies (e.g. raw
    diffs) print verbatim; an empty body emits `{}` under `--json`. API error
    responses are surfaced, and `APIError` JSON now carries `statusCode` and the
    response body.
  - Ambiguous invocations fail loudly: a non-verb first positional
    (`bb api /a /b`) and a lone verb (`bb api GET`) are rejected instead of
    silently dropping an argument.
  - Absolute URLs are restricted to `api.bitbucket.org` so credentials are
    never sent to a foreign host.

- [#284](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/284) [`4f7c990`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/4f7c990b6b357f510e9e6f49891c924357cd7c30) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add `bb auth login --with-token` to read an API token from stdin, so secrets never appear in shell history or `ps` output the way `-p, --password` does. Pipe the token in, e.g. `echo "$BB_API_TOKEN" | bb auth login -u myuser --with-token` — it pairs well with secret managers. Combining `--with-token` with `--password` is rejected, and an empty stdin produces a clear error. Docs also now note that OAuth requires a loopback browser (`http://localhost:19872/callback`) with no device-code flow, so headless users know to use token auth.

### Patch Changes

- [#285](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/285) [`7401de4`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/7401de4b206c8768c0cb5c333a1e5733d9b80045) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Fix the `bb <command> --help` hint shown on validation errors to point at the exact command path. It previously sliced `process.argv` and guessed the first two tokens, which was wrong for top-level commands like `bb browse` and deeply nested ones like `bb pr comments add`. The hint now uses the resolved command path threaded through the command context.

- [#285](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/285) [`7401de4`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/7401de4b206c8768c0cb5c333a1e5733d9b80045) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Run the update-available check after every command instead of only when `bb` is invoked with no subcommand, so users who always run real subcommands see update notices. The notice now prints to stderr and only when stderr is an interactive TTY, output is not `--json`, and not in CI; it continues to honor `skipVersionCheck` and `versionCheckInterval`. This keeps `--json` and piped stdout byte-clean.

## 1.19.0

### Minor Changes

- [`c408616`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/c40861618a2897197f4b2f3ff6fc29f8c84f6e3f) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add `BB_WORKSPACE` environment variable support and tighten the public docs.
  - `BB_WORKSPACE` now feeds into workspace resolution as a fallback between
    git context and `config.defaultWorkspace`. The full precedence is:
    `--workspace` flag → git remote → `BB_WORKSPACE` → `config.defaultWorkspace`.
    Previously, the variable was advertised in `.env.example` but read nowhere.
  - New `reference/global-flags` docs page consolidates every flag that works
    on every command (`--json`, `--jq`, `--no-color`, `--no-unicode`,
    `--no-truncate`, `--limit`, `--all`, `--locale`, `-w`, `-r`).
  - Reference and README env-var tables now list `BB_WORKSPACE`, `BB_LOCALE`,
    and `BB_NO_UNICODE` (previously undocumented). `DEBUG` is clarified as
    requiring the literal string `true`.
  - Changelog page adds entries for 1.15.0 through 1.18.0 (locale, Unicode
    toggle, spinner, global `--no-truncate`, `--all`, pagination hints).
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` trimmed to onboarding-only; deep conventions live in
    `AGENTS.md`.
  - App-password deprecation notices no longer hard-code Atlassian's
    deprecation dates — they link to Atlassian's own page instead.

### Patch Changes

- [`30fa3df`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/30fa3df8e22376fcb8193e3f2da858d57534b618) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Self-host the docs site fonts (DM Sans, JetBrains Mono) via
  `@fontsource-variable` instead of importing from `fonts.googleapis.com`.
  Eliminates the dominant render-blocking request on mobile — Lighthouse
  flagged the Google Fonts stylesheet as wasting ~800 ms of mobile LCP.

  Variable-font files cover the full 400–700 weight range so the previous
  multi-weight CDN URL is now a single bundled woff2 per subset, served
  from the same origin.

  **Deploy-side follow-up** (not in this repo): add
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` for `/_astro/*`.
  Astro emits content-hashed filenames there, so they're safe to cache
  forever. Lighthouse flagged 9 such files at `cache-lifetime=0`.

  Documentation-only change; the CLI is untouched.

- [`d32c44e`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/d32c44e4a60b7db572e485b5b34f1ec7d5885fbf) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Publish `llms.txt` from the docs site so IDE agents (Cursor, Cline,
  Continue, Aider, etc.) can pull a clean markdown view of the documentation
  on demand. Three files are generated at build time:
  - `/llms.txt` — index pointing to the content files
  - `/llms-full.txt` — every doc page as concatenated markdown
  - `/llms-small.txt` — abridged subset excluding Help/FAQ/Changelog

  Implementation uses the `starlight-llms-txt` plugin so the files stay in
  sync with the live docs without manual maintenance. A short section in
  `guides/ai-agents` documents how to point a tool at the URLs.

## 1.18.0

### Minor Changes

- [#245](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/245) [`e52c46c`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/e52c46c7bcd837d98cbbdfffb5e9b75b968d973d) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - List commands now indicate when output was capped by `--limit` and add an `--all` flag to fetch every page. When more results exist than were shown, `repo list`, `pr list`, `pr activity`, `pr comments list`, `snippet list`, and `snippet comments list` print a dimmed footer such as `Showing 25 repositories. Use --limit <n> or --all to see more.` (suppressed in `--json` mode). Pass `--all` to retrieve all results regardless of `--limit`.

### Patch Changes

- [#244](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/244) [`a3b6b51`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/a3b6b514b52dcaf1fc40507008a1ee7693700203) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Fix table output breaking when a cell value contains a newline, carriage return, or tab (e.g. a repository description with a line break). Such whitespace control characters are now collapsed to a single space within table cells so every row stays on one line and columns stay aligned. Multi-line `text()` output is unaffected.

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- [#238](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/238) [`6e5edc7`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/6e5edc780319767b54fc35fae29fd62d96bee1c8) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add a global `--no-truncate` flag that disables column truncation in table output across `bb pr list`, `bb pr activity`, `bb pr checks`, `bb pr edit`, `bb pr comments list`, `bb repo list`, and `bb snippet comments list`. The previously command-local `--no-truncate` flag on `bb pr comments list` is now subsumed by the global flag and no longer needs to be passed separately. JSON output is unaffected.

- [#235](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/235) [`1e388e6`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/1e388e64a0a735bb82b48e66f79a094e3a2a923b) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add locale-aware date formatting. Dates rendered by `bb` now follow the user's
  locale instead of being hard-coded to `en-US`. The locale is resolved in this
  order: `--locale <tag>` global flag, `BB_LOCALE` env var, the standard POSIX
  chain (`LC_TIME` → `LC_ALL` → `LANG`), and finally `en-US` as a fallback. An
  invalid tag silently falls back to `en-US` instead of throwing.

- [#237](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/237) [`8e7e8b7`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/8e7e8b74b78a4cbda2fd772065bea5fa84f0f9c6) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add `--no-unicode` flag and `BB_NO_UNICODE` env var to substitute ASCII fallbacks for Unicode glyphs (separators, arrows, status icons, info/warning/error/success symbols) in non-JSON output. Useful for older terminals, constrained CI environments, or fonts that render the original glyphs as boxes. Mirrors the `gh` CLI's `GH_NO_UNICODE`.

- [#239](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/239) [`71f88c9`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/71f88c9c5e6363fe2158f8b4c45fd45ca8769f97) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add a spinner progress indicator for long-running operations.

  `IOutputService` now exposes a `spinner(text)` factory returning an
  `ISpinner` handle (`start` / `stop` / `succeed` / `fail` / `setText`). The
  spinner auto-disables in JSON mode (would corrupt machine-readable output),
  non-TTY streams (pipes, redirects, CI), and tests — every method is a safe
  no-op there, so callers can instrument commands without branching on the
  runtime environment.

  `OutputService` tracks the active spinner and stops it before any other
  write (`success`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `text`, `table`, `json`,
  `jsonError`), so a forgotten spinner can never interleave with regular
  output. Two concurrent spinners cannot fight over the same line either —
  creating a new spinner stops the previous one.

  Instrumented the high-priority long-running commands listed in the
  proposal:
  - `bb pr create` — "Creating pull request..."
  - `bb pr merge` — "Merging pull request #{id}..."
  - `bb repo clone` — "Cloning {repo}..."

  Implementation is dependency-free (no `ora`); the `Spinner` class lives in
  `src/services/spinner.ts` and renders 10-frame braille animation with
  ANSI cursor hide/show and line-clear sequences. Cursor restore is wired
  to `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `exit` so an interrupted CLI doesn't leave
  the cursor hidden.

### Patch Changes

- [#236](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/236) [`ac59b02`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/ac59b02a613834eb61dcbcf2d3abf3c87237b008) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Centralize horizontal section dividers behind a new `output.separator()` helper so all framed command output (e.g. `pr view`, `pr checks`, `snippet view`, the version-update banner) uses a consistent gray Unicode rule. The version-update banner now renders through `output.warning()` so it picks up proper warning styling instead of an inline `⚠` glyph.

## 1.16.2

### Patch Changes

- [#232](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/232) [`e46e142`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/e46e1426fb58fb09ac2f0d2eff408358d99e5563) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Route API client retry messages through `IOutputService.warning()` so they no longer bypass the output layer. Retries are now silenced in `--json` mode (preventing stderr noise from leaking into structured pipelines) and outside JSON mode they render with the standard `⚠` prefix and respect `--no-color`. `DEBUG=true` HTTP traces continue to use raw `console.debug` by design — they are an opt-in developer channel.

- [#231](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/231) [`edd3023`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/edd3023514e56adf6bf75938d765987aa760cd87) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Standardize empty-result messages on `output.info()` so all list/query
  commands present a consistent blue `ℹ` icon when there is nothing to show.

  Updated commands:
  - `repo list` — `No repositories found`
  - `pr list` — `No <state> pull requests found`
  - `snippet list` — `No snippets found`
  - `config list` — `No configuration set`
  - `pr view` — `No reviewers assigned` (was a gray plain-text line)

  The eight other commands that emit empty-result messages already use
  `output.info()`; they are unchanged.

- [#233](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/233) [`37e7d0e`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/37e7d0e2c27ad6718fcaac03d0d923aa490f33ab) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Standardize the `--yes` confirmation pattern across destructive commands.
  The duplicated check and `BBError` throw is extracted into
  `BaseCommand.requireConfirmation()`, and the trailing instruction is now a
  consistent `Use --yes to confirm.` (previously a mix of
  `Use --yes to confirm.` and `Use --yes to confirm deletion.`).

  Affected commands:
  - `repo delete`
  - `repo default-reviewers remove`
  - `pr comments delete`
  - `snippet delete`
  - `snippet comments delete`

  The warning text describing the action being gated is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- [#221](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/221) [`4f346d3`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/4f346d33d4e603fe353e304b75c63f2940666ffb) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Architectural Phase 1: leverage moves across services and commands.
  - Add `OutputService.truncate()` and remove four duplicate command-local
    copies. Inline `slice + ellipsis` patterns in `pr comments list`,
    `snippet comments list` and `pr edit` now go through the shared helper.
  - Add `BaseCommand.parsePositiveInt()` (strict: rejects "1abc", "1.5",
    zero, negatives) and migrate all `--id`, comment-id, line-to/line-from
    parsers to it. Removes the local `parsePositiveInt` in `bb browse`.
    Error messages now consistently end with a `Run \`bb … --help\` for
    usage.` hint.
  - Add `IContextService.requireRepoContextFor(options, context)` to
    replace the boilerplate
    `requireRepoContext({ ...context.globalOptions, ...options })` that
    appeared in 23 commands.
  - Add a 60-second default timeout to `GitService` so a stalled `git`
    subprocess no longer hangs the CLI; configurable via the constructor.
  - Wrap `JSON.parse` in `ConfigService.getConfig()` so a corrupted config
    file surfaces a `BBError(CONFIG_READ_FAILED)` with a precise message
    instead of a generic `SyntaxError`.
  - Wrap the dynamic `import('jq-wasm')` in `OutputService.runJq` so a
    missing/broken jq runtime surfaces a `BBError(JQ_FAILED)` with
    remediation guidance.
  - Surface causes for opportunistic failures (`version-check` network
    errors, `oauth` browser-open failures) when `DEBUG=true`. Behavior is
    unchanged when DEBUG is unset.
  - Make `pr comments list` and `pr reviewers list` JSON output include
    `workspace` and `repoSlug` for parity with the other list commands.
  - Build now emits sourcemaps (`bun build --sourcemap`).
  - CI now runs `bun run lint:docs` so error-code and env-var docs cannot
    drift unnoticed.

## 1.16.0

### Minor Changes

- [#217](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/217) [`d6c532f`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/d6c532faa980da2e5f8e2c4cfa49e88f18aabbdc) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add `bb browse` command for opening Bitbucket Cloud pages in the browser.

  Mirrors `gh browse`: `bb browse` opens the repo home, `bb browse src/cli.ts:42` opens a file at a line, `bb browse 217` opens PR [#217](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/217), `bb browse abc1234` opens a commit, and resource flags (`--pr`, `--prs`, `--branch`, `--branches`, `--commit`, `--commits`, `--pipelines`, `--pipeline`, `--downloads`, `--issues`, `--issue`, `--wiki`, `--settings`) target specific pages. Use `--no-browser` to print the URL or `--json url` for scripting. Adds a reusable `UrlBuilderService` for centralized Bitbucket URL construction and `GitService.getCurrentCommit()` for HEAD-commit defaulting.

### Patch Changes

- [#219](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/219) [`145212b`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/145212b15344db872bacdac3d007d47c9fe480d1) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Reconcile drift between CLI help, docs, and code (issue [#181](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/181)).
  - `bb auth login --app-password`: clarify that app passwords are deprecated and the flag opts into API token auth.
  - `bb pr list --mine`: tighten help text to say "PRs where you are a reviewer (not authored by you)" so the meaning isn't ambiguous.
  - `bb pr reviewers add` / `remove`: rename the positional from `<username>` to `<user>`, document that it accepts an account ID or `{uuid}`, and update examples (Bitbucket Cloud no longer accepts the legacy login name).
  - `bb snippet create --file` / `bb snippet edit --file`: note in help that the flag is variadic and can be repeated.
  - Docs: add the auto-managed `lastVersionCheck` config key to the configuration reference and include `default-reviewers` in the `bb repo <Tab>` completion example.

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- [#214](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/214) [`8395a68`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/8395a68b22c01a4c69063268ffaf2b6295b14e55) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Make error messages actionable with next-step guidance: auth errors mention both `bb auth login` and the `BB_USERNAME`/`BB_API_TOKEN` env vars; `CONTEXT_REPO_NOT_FOUND` distinguishes between not being in a git repo, missing remote, and non-Bitbucket remotes; 404s on `bb pr view`, `bb repo view`, and `bb snippet view` now name the missing resource; network errors point to `DEBUG=true` and proxy/CA troubleshooting; `bb config get` for hidden keys explains why and points at `bb config list`; `bb pr create` validation includes a `--help` footer; `bb auth login` distinguishes invalid credentials from rate limiting; `bb pr comment` lists the three valid mode combinations.

- [#206](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/206) [`1b46ea8`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/1b46ea87c4e693bb736ba708da0a61e113367f3c) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - feat(errors): add distinguishable error codes for file-not-found and shell completion failures

  Adds three new error codes so JSON-output-driven scripts can branch on the
  specific failure mode instead of treating everything as `VALIDATION_INVALID`
  (5002) or `UNKNOWN` (9999):
  - `FILE_NOT_FOUND` (5003) — used by `bb snippet create/edit --file`,
    `bb snippet view --file`, and `bb pr edit --body-file` when a referenced
    file does not exist on disk or in the snippet
  - `COMPLETION_INSTALL_FAILED` (9001) — `bb completion install` failures
  - `COMPLETION_UNINSTALL_FAILED` (9002) — `bb completion uninstall` failures

  `APIError` now also populates `context` with the failed request method,
  URL and HTTP status, giving scripts structured fields to key on for 404s
  and other API errors.

  The error-code reference docs are updated with the new codes and clarify
  the boundary between `AUTH_INVALID` (1002 — credentials rejected at
  request time) and `AUTH_EXPIRED` (1003 — OAuth token expired _and_ its
  refresh failed).

### Patch Changes

- [#199](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/199) [`76e75a0`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/76e75a0f21608dbeb611be80b9c17e0682c1de35) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - security: anchor `parseRemoteUrl` regex to reject crafted Bitbucket URLs like `git@bitbucket.org:foo/bar.git.attacker.com/x/y`, and redact query strings from request URL DEBUG logs.

- [#210](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/210) [`66b1472`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/66b14722523776cecebcfaeb1ff51ffe0ffc6e5d) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - docs: improve docs site navigation, cross-linking, and discoverability

  Several small surface-level fixes that together close the gap between "I had to
  search" and "I clicked the obvious link". Resolves [#186](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/186).
  - **Changelog page in docs**: new `/help/changelog/` page with a curated
    summary of recent releases plus a link to the full GitHub `CHANGELOG.md`.
    Surfaced in the sidebar under Help.
  - **AI Agents guide linked from README**: the substantial `guides/ai-agents`
    page is now mentioned under the README's Docs section so it's discoverable
    from the npm/GitHub landing.
  - **`See also` section in `bb --help`**: extends `buildHelpText()` with a new
    `seeAlso` config that renders a labeled list of doc URLs. Wired up on the
    global help, `bb pr list`, `bb pr create`, `bb config get`, and
    `bb config set` to point users at the relevant guide.
  - **`bb config list` advertises settable keys**: after the values table, the
    command appends `Settable keys: defaultWorkspace, skipVersionCheck, ...`
    so users discover what they can change without reading `--help` separately.
  - **Stable anchor for `bb repo default-reviewers`**: explicit `<a id="...">`
    before the heading so the cross-link from `pr/create-and-edit` survives any
    future Starlight slug-generator change.
  - **Quickstart documents the version-check nudge**: explains what the upgrade
    message means and how to silence it (`bb config set skipVersionCheck true`).
  - **CLAUDE.md uses a real markdown link to AGENTS.md**: replaces the
    Claude-specific `@AGENTS.md` syntax (which doesn't render as a link in
    generic markdown viewers) with `[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)` and adds a "must
    read" pointer list.

- [#213](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/213) [`a34fdf8`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/a34fdf85a358bf81f7185907f44d705bfcea8fd8) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - docs: add Recipes / Cookbook section with five common workflows — auto-merge when CI is green, bulk reviewer assignment, fork synchronization, reporting & analytics jq patterns, and a retry wrapper for transient failures. Closes [#184](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/184).

- [#200](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/200) [`3ea4760`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/3ea4760810cf0996548eca2e1d6897868f2fd506) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - fix(security): use `open` package in `pr diff --web` instead of shell-string `exec`

  Replaces the platform-specific shell command (`open "${url}"`, `start "" "${url}"`,
  `xdg-open "${url}"`) in `pr diff --web` with the already-bundled `open` package, so the
  URL is no longer interpreted by `/bin/sh` or `cmd.exe`. URLs containing shell
  metacharacters (`&`, `` ` ``, `$`, `"`, `|`, `>`) are now passed verbatim to the
  browser instead of being parsed as shell syntax.

- [#204](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/204) [`2c2aa88`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/2c2aa8848e4f4c8a1952126e9cf0f1e8df20893a) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - security: harden config-file integrity
  - Write the config via a unique tmp file with `O_EXCL` (`flag: 'wx'`) and an
    atomic `rename`, so a hostile pre-existing symlink at `config.json` is no
    longer silently followed and a crash mid-write cannot leave a partially
    written config behind.
  - On read, refuse to open `config.json` (or its containing directory) with
    group/world-accessible permissions — the co-tenant scenario where another
    user pre-creates the file with `0o644` before the first login is now
    surfaced as a clear error with the exact `chmod` command to fix it.
  - Create the config directory with mode `0o700` and the config file with
    mode `0o600`.

- [#202](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/202) [`3586adb`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/3586adba841ea538e5b5cf34903251db2be143ec) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - security: harden OAuth callback flow
  - Bind the local OAuth callback server to `127.0.0.1` instead of all
    interfaces so the auth window is not reachable from the LAN.
  - Bump the OAuth `state` parameter from 128 to 256 bits.
  - Add a 10s timeout to every `fetch()` in the OAuth flow (token exchange,
    refresh, revoke, user-info) so a hung Bitbucket endpoint cannot stall
    the CLI indefinitely.
  - Surface token-revocation failures on logout as a warning instead of
    silently dropping them; local credentials are still cleared.

- [#211](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/211) [`bfa6339`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/bfa6339c0d2dce8fc54d9294ed7c98a3a0309756) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - improve onboarding and first-run experience
  - README install section now leads with a Bun preflight (`bun --version`),
    steps users through Bun + CLI install, and points out
    `bb completion install` for tab completion.
  - README gains a short Environment Variables table covering `BB_USERNAME`,
    `BB_API_TOKEN`, `DEBUG`, `NO_COLOR`, and `FORCE_COLOR`, with a link to the
    full reference.
  - `bb` invoked with no subcommand now appends a one-line tip suggesting
    `bb auth login` when no credentials are configured.
  - `bb auth login --help` now leads with the recommended method (OAuth),
    notes the API-token path for CI, and surfaces the app-password
    deprecation up front.

- [#198](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/198) [`71c0767`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/71c0767970074d3febfc64b768ae2157a98d33b2) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - security: stop persisting the OAuth token-endpoint response body in `BBError.context`. The raw body could include attacker-influenced data when a custom OAuth provider was configured via `--client-id`/`--client-secret`, and surfaced through `--json` error output. The error now exposes only `{ status }` in `context`; if the response is a JSON body with `error_description`, a sanitized, length-capped excerpt is folded into the user-facing `message`.

- [#197](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/197) [`cf5390d`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/cf5390db5090a42f30738ecbc50dd1ad0dbe6f47) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - security: add PKCE (S256) to the OAuth authorization-code flow. The CLI now generates a per-login `code_verifier`, sends `code_challenge` + `code_challenge_method=S256` on the authorize redirect, and supplies the verifier on token exchange. An attacker who intercepts only the authorization code can no longer redeem it.

- [#201](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/201) [`fe955aa`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/fe955aa4539a5167d3096e907ad0d0c053eda346) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - security: strip ANSI / OSC / control characters from terminal output

  Untrusted strings from the API (PR titles, descriptions, branch names,
  snippet file names, repo descriptions, etc.) are now sanitized before
  being printed by `OutputService`. This blocks terminal-spoofing primitives
  such as OSC-8 hyperlink injection, OSC-0 terminal-title rewrites, and
  CSI cursor / screen-clear sequences. Chalk-generated SGR color codes
  composed by commands continue to render normally. JSON output is
  unchanged.

- [#208](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/208) [`3404203`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/3404203516c6b5736767b1ff1734054dd7e76408) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - docs(cli): standardize `--help` text coverage across all commands. PR `approve`/`decline`/`ready`/`checkout`, PR `comments edit`/`delete`, PR `reviewers add`/`remove`, snippet `watch`/`unwatch`/`comments delete`/`comments edit`, `auth logout`, and `completion install`/`uninstall` now include multiple realistic examples and (where applicable) `validValues` blocks. `pr merge --strategy` documents the API default. `bb snippet comments add` now also accepts `<message>` as a positional argument for parity with `bb pr comments add`, and its help marks the message as required. A new test guarantees every leaf command exposes an Examples block.

- [#212](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/212) [`ff96045`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/ff9604578839e398bdabfd5fbb6c17d19bc93914) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - docs: surface `--json <fields>` projection and `--jq` filter throughout README, quickstart, per-command pages, and CLI help

  Adds the `--jq` flag to the README global options, a scripting callout in the
  quickstart, and `--json fields` / `--jq` examples to the highest-traffic command
  pages (`pr list`, `pr view`, `pr create`, `repo list`, `snippet list`). The
  `--jq` description in `bb --help` now includes an inline example, and the
  `reference/json-output.mdx` page gains a before/after shape comparison and three
  additional combined projection + jq patterns.

  No CLI behavior changes — `--json [fields]` and `--jq <expression>` already
  existed; this PR is purely about discoverability.

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [#176](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/176) [`87b68ae`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/87b68ae9c338c84acbed121ffaca67ffa7cadfb8) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - feat: add `--json <fields>` projection and `--jq <expression>` filter to JSON output

  Match the `gh` CLI's JSON formatting flags so muscle memory and scripts port over cleanly:
  - `--json [fields]` accepts an optional comma-separated field list (e.g. `--json number,title,author.display_name`). Bare `--json` keeps the existing full-object output for backwards compatibility.
  - `--jq <expression>` runs the JSON output through a [`jq-wasm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jq-wasm) embedded jq engine. Requires `--json`.
  - Field projection drops the wrapper around list-style results (e.g. `pullRequests`, `repositories`, `snippets`) and projects per-item, matching `gh` semantics.
  - Dotted paths (`author.display_name`) traverse nested objects.
  - Invalid jq expressions exit non-zero with the underlying jq error.

  Examples:

  ```bash
  bb pr list --json number,title,state
  bb pr list --json author --jq '.[].author.display_name'
  bb pr list --json number,title,state --jq '.[] | select(.state == "OPEN") | .title'
  ```

## 1.13.2

### Patch Changes

- [#169](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/169) [`e359340`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/e35934022a4ff7b27a65f6f78e5b04a8bd74d602) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - ci: harden workflows and unblock Windows contributors

  Pins Bun and every GitHub Action to explicit versions/SHAs, caches the Bun install directory, adds cancel-in-progress for PR runs, and drops the `grep "0 fail"` hack that could mask real test output. Release no longer tags or publishes until lint, format, and tests all pass, and stops swallowing GitHub Packages publish failures. CI now runs the full test + build on ubuntu, macos, and windows.

  Surface fix while adding the matrix: `ConfigService.getConfigPath()` now uses `posix.join` on simulated non-Windows platforms so path resolution is correct when developers run the tests on Windows.

- [`afa554e`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/afa554e2e2f849aa7475cb0feba57b018523618d) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - refactor(cli): extract PR states constant and collapse completion if/else into a map

  Internal-only change — no user-facing behavior change.
  - **`PR_STATES` constant**: The literal list `['OPEN', 'MERGED', 'DECLINED', 'SUPERSEDED']` was written out three times — once in `pr/list.command.ts` as the option validator, once in `cli.ts` as the `--state` description, and once in the help text's `Valid states`. Lifted to a new `src/types/pr.ts` export so future additions only touch one place.
  - **Tabtab completion**: The `env.prev` dispatch in `cli.ts` was an eight-branch if/else chain hand-maintained next to Commander's command tree. Replaced with a single `ReadonlyMap<parent, subcommands>` table, keeping the special-case `comments` disambiguation (its parent can be `pr` or `snippet`) separate. Same completions, fewer branches to keep in sync.

- [#168](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/168) [`9d1122b`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/9d1122b3ae205d96158bb52d56f6457cd9d277e1) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - refactor(context): consolidate workspace resolution onto `ContextService`

  Internal cleanup — no behavior change. The standalone `resolveWorkspace()` helper is folded into `IContextService.requireWorkspace()`, so every command that needs workspace-or-repo context now depends on the same service. Snippet and workspace-only repo commands (`repo list` / `repo create` / `repo clone`) are migrated to inject `ContextService` instead of `ConfigService`, and `src/services/workspace-resolver.ts` is removed. Resolves [#146](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/146).

- [`7da1646`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/7da1646c1aee8d6503ed2625d18a75688077faca) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - refactor(context): drop pointless `new RegExp(/literal/)` wrapping in remote URL parser

  Internal-only change — no behavior change. `ContextService.parseRemoteUrl` constructed its SSH and HTTPS regexes as `new RegExp(/.../).exec(url)`, which wraps an already-compiled regex literal in a second `RegExp` constructor call. Replaced with direct `/regex/.exec(url)` calls.

- [`b525659`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/b5256594b2114e3bd46948db00846b6efc5a7a1a) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - refactor(services): drop duplicate types and unnecessary casts

  Internal-only change — no user-facing behavior change. Three small cleanups in `src/services/`:
  - `reviewer.service.ts` redefined its own `RepoContext` interface identical to the canonical one in `src/types/config.ts`. Removed the duplicate and imported the shared type.
  - `extractReviewerUuids` and `buildReviewersUpdateBody` were re-exported from `src/services/index.ts` but only consumed inside `reviewer.service.ts` itself (and the colocated tests, which already import from the module directly). Narrowed the barrel to just `updatePullRequestReviewers`.
  - `coerceVersionCheckIntervalValue(intervalDays as unknown)` in `version.service.ts` cast the argument to `unknown` unnecessarily — the coerce function accepts `unknown` already, and `IConfigService.getValue` returns a typed value.

- [#160](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/160) [`20cc179`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/20cc1792145b35d48478251d7a9c9340e0aa8795) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Housekeeping bundle ([#150](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/150)):
  - Document why the OAuth default client credentials shipped in the CLI are not a secret leak, so future readers don't rotate them thinking they were exposed.
  - Add a `.npmignore` as belt-and-suspenders alongside the existing `files` whitelist in `package.json`.
  - Replace the fragile substring check that disambiguated `bb snippet comments` from `bb pr comments` during tab completion with a tokenized parent-command lookup. Also enables `list / add / edit / delete` completions for `bb pr comments <TAB>`, which previously offered none.

- [#166](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/166) [`d2ffe97`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/d2ffe97b02d1997b0f8f10dd2c6f9ec8ebd0aaa2) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - fix(pagination): reject `--limit 0` and other non-positive values instead of silently returning no results

  `parseLimit` previously fell back to the default limit when given `0`, a negative number, or a non-numeric string — except for `collectPages`, which honored `0` by returning an empty array. A user passing `--limit 0` got zero results with no feedback. `parseLimit` now throws a `VALIDATION_INVALID` `BBError` (`--limit must be a positive integer`) for any explicit non-positive or non-finite value. A missing option still returns the fallback. Adds a dedicated `tests/services/pagination.test.ts` covering `parseLimit` and `collectPages`. Resolves [#145](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/145).

- [#162](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/162) [`a078adc`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/a078adc0b8bc579aeac1cebec03db3e50cfbcb3e) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - refactor(bootstrap): collapse DI registrations behind `registerApiClient` and `registerCommand` helpers

  Internal cleanup — no behavior change. `bootstrap.ts` shrinks from ~874 to ~591 lines by extracting two local helpers:
  - `registerApiClient(container, token, ctor)` for generated OpenAPI clients (ConfigService + OAuthService + axios wiring).
  - `registerCommand(container, token, ctor, deps)` for the ~40 commands (and simple services) whose factory is just `resolve → resolve → new Cmd(...)`.

  Adding a new command is now a 3–8 line registration instead of a ~10 line boilerplate block. Resolves [#147](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/147).

- [`0ed48dd`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/0ed48dd0d13cfa0a21ce783f0cab5656686adc9c) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - fix(snippet): replace `as unknown as` casts in snippet comment commands with real types

  Internal-only change — no user-facing behavior change. The generated `SnippetComment` extends `ModelObject` which carries an `[key: string]: any` index signature, so the surrounding `as unknown as SnippetComment` / `as unknown as Record<string, unknown>` casts in `comments.add`, `comments.edit`, and `comments.list` were load-bearing only because nobody had tried the direct typing. Constructing the request bodies as `SnippetComment` directly and reading response fields without the intermediate record cast keeps the same runtime behaviour while narrowing the places TypeScript is told to look the other way.

- [#167](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/167) [`d99b276`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/d99b2768fcb5788c812625ae6212ace3d0470fbb) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - refactor(config): split `IConfigService` into `IConfigService` + `ICredentialStore`

  Internal-only change — no user-facing behavior or on-disk format changes. The old `IConfigService` mixed three concerns (app config, basic auth credentials, OAuth token state), forcing every consumer and test mock to depend on the full surface even when they only needed one piece.
  - `IConfigService` now covers app config only: `getConfig`, `getValue`, `setValue`, `getConfigPath`, `clearConfig`.
  - New `ICredentialStore` covers basic + OAuth credentials: `getAuthMethod`, `get/set/clearCredentials`, `get/set/clearOAuthCredentials`, `isOAuthTokenExpired`.
  - `ConfigService` keeps implementing both, so the same JSON file backs both interfaces. A `ServiceTokens.CredentialStore` registration is added as an alias resolving the same singleton, leaving an opening for a future alternative store (e.g. OS keychain) without touching non-auth consumers.
  - Commands and services now inject the narrower dependency they actually use. Test mocks gain `createMockConfigServiceOnly` and `createMockCredentialStoreOnly` factories for tests that only exercise one surface.

  Resolves [#148](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/148).

- [#161](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/161) [`14f768c`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/14f768c7cca5005173b5ae6dea53e2739bc13a7c) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Test infrastructure cleanup ([#149](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/issues/149)):
  - Centralize the OAuth-capable mock config service in `tests/setup.ts`; `tests/services/api-client.test.ts` now reuses `createMockConfigService` instead of rolling its own duplicate factories.
  - Track temp dirs created by `tests/services/snippet-files.service.test.ts` and remove them in `afterEach` so `bb-snippet-*` dirs no longer accumulate under `$TMPDIR` across test runs.

- [#165](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/165) [`8170770`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/8170770004d69d50410776cc9327380ef3f32725) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - chore(tsconfig): tighten type-checking for TypeScript 6
  - Enable `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `isolatedModules`, and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` for stricter, Bun-aligned type-checking.
  - Replace legacy `bun-types` entry with `bun` (matches the `@types/bun` dependency).
  - Drop `declaration`, `outDir`, and `rootDir` — no-ops under `noEmit: true`, since builds go through `bun build`.

  No runtime behavior change. A handful of internal `string | undefined` sites from regex captures and guaranteed-index array access were narrowed with non-null assertions.

- [#164](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/164) [`73e2b24`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/73e2b2433d33f170fee63e75c5fb797d894bb7fd) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - chore(deps): upgrade dependencies
  - `axios` 1.13.2 → 1.15.0
  - `commander` 14.0.2 → 14.0.3
  - `@changesets/cli` 2.29.8 → 2.31.0
  - `@changesets/changelog-github` 0.5.2 → 0.6.0
  - `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` 2.28.0 → 2.31.1
  - `@types/bun` 1.3.5 → 1.3.12
  - `@types/node` 25.1.0 → 25.6.0
  - `prettier` 3.8.1 → 3.8.3
  - `typescript` 5.9.3 → 6.0.3

  TypeScript 6 migration verified: project already uses `moduleResolution: bundler`, strict mode, and ESM — none of the removed legacy flags or the dropped `node` resolution are in use. `tsc --noEmit`, full test suite (788 tests), and `bun build` all pass.

### Patch Changes

- [`071fb12`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/071fb12b248d82dccd10a19972f122f47df031b8) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Refresh the generated Bitbucket Cloud API client from the latest spec. Adds a post-generation patch script that dedupes duplicate enum declarations and corrects `PipelineSelector.type` optionality so the generated output type-checks. Call-site adjustments only (no user-facing behavior change): the renamed OpenAPI request-body parameters (`body` → `pullrequest` / `pullrequestComment` / `pullrequestMergeParameters` / `repository` / `snippetComment`) are now used, and `Participant.state`'s new nullable type is coerced where consumed.

## 1.13.0

- [`07ff5ac`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/07ff5ac0ca025b571a84995aaf5c10f60880d9ce) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add support for Bitbucket Default Reviewers (closes #139).
  - New `bb repo default-reviewers list|add|remove` commands to inspect and manage the default reviewers of a repository. `list` shows the effective set (repo-level plus project-inherited) by default; pass `--direct` for only repo-level entries. `remove` requires `--yes` to confirm.
  - `bb pr create` gains opt-in support for default reviewers:
    - `--default-reviewers` fetches and attaches the repository's effective default reviewers (matching the web UI behavior).
    - `--reviewer <username>` (repeatable) adds explicit reviewers independent of the defaults.
    - `--no-default-reviewers` skips defaults when the config key enables them.
    - The PR author is automatically excluded from the reviewer list.
  - New config key `prCreateIncludeDefaultReviewers` (boolean, default `false`) makes `--default-reviewers` the default behavior on `bb pr create`.

  - `bb pr view`, `bb pr activity`, `bb pr merge`, and `bb pr checks` now validate `<id>` as an integer and fail fast with a clear `--id must be a valid integer` error instead of silently passing `NaN` to the Bitbucket API.
  - `bb pr activity --type` now rejects unknown activity types (e.g. `--type commetn`) with a `--type must be one of: …` error instead of silently returning zero results.
  - Removed the redundant local `--json` flag on `bb pr checks`; use the global `--json` option instead.

Invalid values now fail fast with a helpful `--strategy must be one of: …` message instead of surfacing as an opaque Bitbucket API error.

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- [#135](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/pull/135) [`43481c1`](https://github.com/0pilatos0/bitbucket-cli/commit/43481c10c4ff864b2895577a2ef3daa5e122a16b) Thanks [@0pilatos0](https://github.com/0pilatos0)! - Add snippet command group with full CRUD support for Bitbucket snippets.

  New commands:
  - `bb snippet list` — list workspace snippets, optional `--role` filter (`owner`, `contributor`, `member`)
  - `bb snippet view <id>` — view snippet details; `--file <name>` prints one file, `--files` prints all
  - `bb snippet create` — create snippets via `multipart/form-data`, uploading one or more `--file` arguments as the snippet body
  - `bb snippet edit <id>` — update title/visibility (JSON PUT) or replace/add files (multipart PUT) via `--file`
  - `bb snippet delete <id>` — delete snippets (requires `--yes`)
  - `bb snippet watch <id>` / `bb snippet unwatch <id>` — manage snippet watching
  - `bb snippet comments list | add | edit | delete` — full comments CRUD

  All commands support `--json` output and workspace resolution via `--workspace` or the `defaultWorkspace` config key.

  Internal refactor: a shared `resolveWorkspace()` helper now backs every
  workspace-scoped command (snippet + `repo list` / `repo create` / `repo clone`), removing several copies of the same fallback logic.

  This is a significant internal refactoring that migrates the CLI from manual API types to a fully generated axios-based API client:

  **Changes:**
  - Switch OpenAPI generator from `typescript-fetch` to `typescript-axios`
  - Generate API client from Bitbucket OpenAPI spec (54,302 lines of generated code)
  - Remove manual type definitions (`src/types/api.ts`)
  - Remove Result pattern and replace with standard Promises
  - Delete repository layer (`src/repositories/`)
  - Delete custom HTTP client (`src/services/http.client.ts`)
  - Update all 32+ commands to use generated APIs
  - Fix all TypeScript errors (0 errors)
  - Update all 298 tests to work with new architecture
  - Update documentation (CONTRIBUTING.md, AGENTS.md)

  **Technical Details:**
  - Collections returned as `Set<T>` are converted to arrays using `Array.from()`
  - API request bodies include required `type` fields
  - Uses axios interceptors for authentication and error handling
  - All services now use standard Promise-based error handling

  New commands for managing reviewers on pull requests to enable reviewer assignment and management from CLI:
  - **`bb pr reviewers add <id> <username>`** - Add a reviewer to a pull request by username
  - **`bb pr reviewers remove <id> <username>`** - Remove a reviewer from a pull request by username
  - **`bb pr reviewers list <id>`** - List all reviewers on a pull request

  Example usage:

  ```bash
  # Add a reviewer to PR #123
  bb pr reviewers add 123 johndoe

  # Remove a reviewer from PR #123
  bb pr reviewers remove 123 johndoe

  # List all reviewers on PR #123
  bb pr reviewers list 123
  ```

  Features:
  - Supports `--json` flag for programmatic consumption
  - Automatically looks up user UUID from username via `/users/{username}` endpoint
  - Uses UUID for all reviewer comparisons (not deprecated username field)
  - Displays reviewers in a formatted table (display name and account ID)
  - Shows helpful message when no reviewers are assigned

  Note: Due to Bitbucket Cloud GDPR changes, the `username` field is deprecated. The commands use UUID for identification and display `account_id` in list output.

  Bug fix for issue #41:
  - Fixed `approve()` method to send empty JSON object `{}` as request body
  - Fixed `decline()` method to send empty JSON object `{}` as request body
  - Enhanced mock HTTP client to capture and verify request bodies in tests
  - Added tests to verify approve/decline send correct body format

  The Bitbucket Cloud API requires POST requests to approve/decline endpoints to have a request body. Previously, the body was `undefined`, causing 400 Bad Request errors.

  As of September 9, 2025, Bitbucket has deprecated app passwords in favor of API tokens. All existing app passwords will be disabled on June 9, 2026.

  ## Breaking Changes
  - Configuration field `appPassword` renamed to `apiToken`
  - Environment variable `BB_APP_PASSWORD` renamed to `BB_API_TOKEN`
  - All references to "app password" updated to "API token" in docs and CLI output

  ## Migration Guide

  After upgrading, users will need to:
  1. Create a new API token at https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/api-tokens/
  2. Re-authenticate using `bb auth login -u your-username -p your-api-token`

  The authentication mechanism (HTTP Basic Auth) remains unchanged - only the terminology and configuration field names have changed.

  ## Documentation Updates
  - Updated authentication guide with API token creation instructions
  - Updated all command documentation references
  - Added deprecation notices about app passwords

  Commands that set `process.exitCode = 1` on error were causing false test failures.
  The exit code persisted across test files, making `bun test` exit with code 1 even
  when all 344 tests passed. This fix skips setting the exit code when `NODE_ENV=test`.
