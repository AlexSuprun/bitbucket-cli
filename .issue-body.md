## Bug Description

The `bb pr comments list` command has two issues:

### 1. Author shows as "Unknown"
When listing comments on a pull request, the author column always shows "Unknown" instead of the actual user name.

**Root Cause**: The Bitbucket API returns user data under the `user` field, but the code was looking for `author`. Additionally, the API uses `nickname` (not `username`) for the user's handle.

**API Response**:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "display_name": "Paul",
    "nickname": "Pilatos",
    ...
  }
}
```

### 2. Deleted comments show empty content
Deleted comments appear in the list with blank content, which is confusing.

**Expected Behavior**:
- Author should display the user's nickname or display name
- Deleted comments should show "[deleted]" to indicate their status

## Files Changed
- `src/types/api.ts`: Changed `author` to `user` in `BitbucketComment` interface
- `src/commands/pr/comments.list.command.ts`: 
  - Updated to use `user.nickname` instead of `author.username`
  - Added handling for deleted comments to show "[deleted]"

## Testing
Tested with PR #5 on a test repository. Comments now correctly show the author name and deleted comments are marked appropriately.
